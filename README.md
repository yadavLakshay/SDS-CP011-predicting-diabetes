# Welcome to the SuperDataScience Community Project!
Welcome to the California Housing Prediction repository! 🎉

This project is a collaborative initiative brought to you by SuperDataScience, a thriving community dedicated to advancing the fields of data science, machine learning, and AI. We are excited to have you join us in this journey of learning, experimentation, and growth.

## About This Project
In this repository, you’ll find the work carried out by our community members in completing an end-to-end machine learning project. Please note that the resources available here is not to be used or copied without referencing the appropriate authors.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to build and deploy a machine learning model that accurately predicts the salary for data science positions. This will involve data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure that the model provides reliable and actionable salary forecasts.

## Project Phases & Timelines
**Data Cleaning & Analysis** (Week 1)
- Handling missing values, formatting data types, fixing data inconsistencies.
- EDA, distribution analysis of features, correlation of features to target variable.

**Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** (Week 2)
- Engineering new features, handling outliers
- Preprocess data to be used for model training

**Model Selection & Hyperparameter** Tuning (Week 3)
- Model training, model evaluation, model selection
- Hyperparameter tuning of selected model, improving accuracy

**Web App Deployment** (Week 4)
- Building a basic streamlit app to make use of the model
- Deploy app to streamlit cloud
